## Unique Aspects of This Repo
We are striving for this repo to be a close to 'self-maintained' as possible.
A decent amount of the core code (the configuration files themselves) are auto-generated
by a tool called `configen` which we are working on directly within `hydra`. Generally,
users of these configs do not have to understand how to use `configen`. However, if you
plan to contribute, it will be much easier if you have taken a look at
[how `configen` works](https://github.com/facebookresearch/hydra/tree/master/tools/configen) first.

Put simply, think of the directory `/configen` as the source for the core configs.
We regenerate configs using the `configen` command

```sh
configen --config-dir configen/conf --config-name pytorch_lightning
```


## Pull Requests
We're ready for your pull requests! Don't be shy about it. If you are working through
and idea, put it up as soon as you can as a "draft" PR, and we will offer help.

Here's the workflow:

1. Fork the repo and create your feature branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code, add suitable tests.
3. Ensure the test suite and lint pass.

## Issues
Please file issue if you require a new config we have not provided, have an idea for a useful tutorial, or notice a bug.
